Troubleshooting Login Issues
============================

If you encounter any issues when logging in, consider the following common problems and solutions:

1. **Incorrect Email or Password**
If you receive an error indicating that your email or password is incorrect, double-check the spelling of your email address and make sure that Caps Lock is turned off. Passwords are case-sensitive, so be sure to enter it exactly as it was set during registration.

2. **Forgotten Password**
If you can’t remember your EarthLink Webmail password, click the **“Forgot Password”** link on the login page. This will guide you through the process of resetting your password. You’ll be asked to provide your EarthLink email address or account details, and EarthLink will send instructions to your recovery email address or phone number.

3. **Account Locked**
If you’ve attempted to log in multiple times with incorrect information, your account may be temporarily locked for security reasons. If this happens, wait 15–30 minutes before attempting to log in again. If the issue persists, contact EarthLink customer support for assistance.

4. **Browser Cache and Cookies**
Sometimes, issues with logging into EarthLink Webmail can arise due to outdated cache or cookies in your browser. To resolve this, clear your browser’s cache and cookies, then try logging in again.

5. **Check Internet Connection**
Ensure that you have a stable internet connection. A slow or intermittent connection may cause login failures, especially if the login page is taking too long to load.

**Spam Filtering**

Security Features
=================

EarthLink Webmail provides several security features to protect your account and personal data. Here are some of the key security features:

**Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)**
------------------------------------

EarthLink offers two-factor authentication (2FA) for added security. When enabled, 2FA requires a second verification step (usually a code sent to your phone) after entering your password. This adds an extra layer of protection to your account.

To enable 2FA, log into your EarthLink Webmail account, navigate to the **Security Settings**, and follow the instructions to set it up.

**Secure Email Protocols**
--------------------------

EarthLink uses secure email protocols (such as TLS and SSL) to encrypt communications between your device and their servers. This ensures that your data is protected from potential eavesdropping or interception.

**Password Management**
-----------------------

It’s essential to maintain a strong password for your EarthLink Webmail account. EarthLink recommends using a combination of uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters. Additionally, avoid using easily guessable information like your name or birthdate.

For added security, change your password regularly and avoid using the same password for multiple accounts.
